from socket manpage:

    SO_RCVBUF
           Sets or gets the maximum socket receive buffer in bytes.  The
           kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping
           overhead) when it is set using setsockopt(2), and this doubled
           value is returned by getsockopt(2).  The default value is set
           by the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default file, and the maximum
           allowed value is set by the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max file.
           The minimum (doubled) value for this option is 256.
